  "editor-overview": `# Cut editor overview
Cut is a local, project-based short-video editor. Each project has an output aspect — 9:16 vertical (1080×1920, TikTok/Reels/Shorts) or 16:9 widescreen (1920×1080, YouTube) — switchable from the pill in the top bar; the current one is in editor_state project.aspect. Layout:
- Left icon rail tabs: Media (user-imported files + Exports list), Library (shared reusable assets), Video (stock clip browser — footage + talking characters — beside the AI video generator), Image (stock images beside the AI image generator), Audio (AI voiceover + audio files), Text (title presets), Subtitles (transcript editor), Publish (caption/tags/sound metadata). Camera/mic recording lives in the top bar next to the aspect picker.
- Media shows only what the user imported. Everything Cut makes carries an origin tag (generated, voiceover, recording, stock, freeze, chat — see \`media\` in editor_state) and lives where it was created — media you make previews on a card in this chat, panel renders sit in their job lists; a "…" menu on each files it into Media or the Library, and every card drags onto the timeline. Deleting a chat thread deletes the chat media the user never placed or filed away.
- Center: the video preview canvas (composited at the project's frame size) with draggable text overlays and subtitle captions.
- Right: the Inspector — its content follows the selection (video clip, overlay video, soundtrack clip, title, or cue).
- Bottom: the timeline (resizable by dragging its top border). Rows top-to-bottom: the video tracks in z-order (positive tracks, then track 0, then negative tracks behind it), soundtrack lanes (green), titles (purple), subtitle tracks (amber, when enabled). Every track is free-positioned in time.
Everything autosaves to the project folder. Undo/redo is unlimited (⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z).
Times are in seconds on the shared timeline. The playhead is currentTime; a skimmer previews under the mouse without moving the playhead.`,

  "timeline-editing": `# Timeline editing
- Every track is free-positioned: items carry a start time, gaps are allowed, and a track-0 gap plays black (and silence). Deleting leaves a gap. videoTrack entries in editor_state report gapBefore where one exists.
- Two ways to move a track-0 clip: place_clip sets its start (respects gaps, slides right if the spot is taken); move_clip reorders by index, opening a slot at the landing point — clips after it shift right, every other gap survives. Index-based inserts (freeze_frame, generated clips) open a slot the same way.
- add_clip puts a project asset on the timeline the way a drag does: video/image onto track 0 (a \`start\`, an \`index\` insert, or appended at the end), audio onto the soundtrack.
- Overlay video: a video/image asset can sit on a track above track 0 (track 1, 2… — topmost wins) or behind it (track -1…). A full-frame overlay covers everything below it; give it a layout to share the frame — top/bottom/left/right halves for a split screen, pip for a floating corner box, or a custom region rect. add_overlay_video creates one from a media asset; update_overlay_video moves/trims/regions/mutes/hides it. The user makes them by dragging media above/below track 0; they drag the region in the preview.
- A clip's timeline length is (out-in)/speed; total duration runs to the last clip's end, gaps included, minus cross-style transition overlaps.
- trim_clip changes in/out inside the source media. in >= 0, out <= source duration, out-in >= 0.1.
- set_speed sets a clip's playback rate; it changes the clip's timeline length, and later titles/captions ripple to stay in sync.
- set_transition joins a clip into the next one (0–2s, six styles) — read the transitions-and-fades skill before styling cuts. Splitting or deleting clears the affected transition.
- split_at cuts the track-0 clip under that time into two clips at the exact frame. With a soundtrack or overlay clip selected it splits that instead.
- The user can multi-select (⌘/⇧-click) and delete several items at once; a hover chip on each video clip toggles its own audio.
- detach_audio lifts a video clip's sound to the soundtrack track (and mutes the clip) so audio can be cut independently of video.
- freeze_frame grabs one frame (default: the playhead — what the user currently sees) as a still clip and inserts it, by default at index 0 as a cover/hook frame ("make this the first frame"). The still is baked at the project's current aspect with the clip's framing applied; if the user later switches aspect they should capture a fresh one.
- set_framing: per-clip Fit (letterbox) vs Fill (crop to cover the project frame). In Fill, panX/panY position the crop window; the user can also drag the video directly in the preview. The control lives in the Inspector under "Framing" when a video clip is selected. Landscape footage usually wants fill + a pan that keeps the subject.
- The user can copy/paste any selected segment (video, overlay video, audio, title) with ⌘C/⌘V; pastes aim for the playhead and slide right to free space.
- Zoom: set_view pxPerSec (12..800) or fit. The timeline panel height: set_view timelineH (170..600).`,

  "watching-and-cutting": `# Watching footage & cutting by content
When a request depends on what the footage actually contains — "cut the dead air", "clip the best moment", "remove the boring part", "split where the scene changes" — watch it first. Never guess at content you haven't seen.

Your eyes and ears:
- watch_video(clip_id | asset_id, from?, to?, interval_seconds?): samples the SOURCE at scene changes plus a steady floor and returns timestamped contact sheets — cells read left→right, top→bottom, and each burned stamp is source seconds — plus sceneChanges, the natural cut candidates. Coverage is capped per call: survey the whole range at the default interval first, then zoom into the moments that matter with a narrow from/to and interval_seconds 0.5–1. When truncated, continue from coveredTo.
- detect_silence(clip_id | asset_id, threshold_db?, min_silence?): silent stretches in source seconds; with clip_id each also carries its timeline times.
- capture_frame: one composited frame at the playhead — for checking the final look, not for surveying footage.

The flow for "edit this for me":
1. get_state — every clip, its trim (in/out), speed, gaps, and the other tracks.
2. Speech? subtitles_generate first — cue timings are timeline seconds and say what is said when.
3. watch_video each distinct source (or the ranges in question); note scene changes and what happens where.
4. Trimming dead air: detect_silence, then cross-check cue gaps so a cut never clips a word.
5. Execute: split_at (timeline s) to divide, delete_item to drop a segment, trim_clip (source s) to tighten edges, place_clip/move_clip to close gaps or reorder, set_speed to compress slow stretches.
6. Verify: seek to each new cut; capture_frame when the change is visual.

Time math (get this right):
- watch_video, detect_silence, and trim_clip speak SOURCE seconds; split_at and place_clip speak TIMELINE seconds.
- timeline_t = clip.start + (source_t − clip.in) / clip.speed, valid while source_t is inside [in, out]. Each watch result's clip block carries this formula with the real numbers filled in.
- The same source can appear in several clips — map per clip.

Cutting dead air well: leave ~0.2s of breathing room around speech; prefer split_at + delete_item, then place_clip to close the gap (a beat of black may be wanted — ask the cut, not the tool); trim_clip only tightens a clip's edges.`,

  "transitions-and-fades": `# Transitions & fades
Three fade-like features exist; route the ask to the right one:
- set_transition: a styled join between one video clip and the next.
- set_project_fade: the whole video fades in from black at the start and/or out to black at the end — picture and full mix (titles, captions, soundtrack). Survives clip reordering. For "fade in the video", "fade to black at the end", use this. Shown as "Fade in"/"Fade out" on the first/last clip's Inspector panel.
- update_audio fadeIn/fadeOut: audio-only ramps on one soundtrack clip ("fade the music out").

set_transition(clipId, seconds, style): clipId is the leading clip of the joint; 0 clears, max 2s. Styles:
- crossfade (default): A blends into B. Overlaps the clips, so the cut shortens by the duration.
- crosszoom: the blend plus a zoom punch — A pushes in (1→1.18×) while B settles back. Also overlaps.
- zoomin: A's tail zooms in across a hard cut (duration unchanged). zoomout: B's head settles from zoomed to normal.
- fadeout: A's tail fades to black (its audio too), then a hard cut. fadein: B's head fades up from black.
Picking for a vibe: "smooth/dissolve" → crossfade; "punchy/energetic/zoom" → crosszoom; "dramatic pause/scene change" → fadeout 0.5–0.8s; between clips 0.4–0.8s reads well, 1s+ is slow and cuts total duration for cross styles.
UI: select a clip → Inspector "Transition" (style) + "Length"; a blue badge marks each styled joint on the timeline. Preview and export render the same look.`,

  "titles": `# Titles (text overlays)
Each overlay: text, start/end (seconds visible), x/y center (fractions 0..1 of the project frame), size (frame px; the design short side is 1080), font (sf=SF Pro, serif=New York, rounded, mono, impact), weight (400/700), color (any CSS color), shadow (bool), plate (translucent dark plate behind the text).
Inspector shows these when a title is selected. The color row has fixed swatches, a custom picker, and the last 3 custom colors.
Good TikTok titles: short punchy lines, high contrast (white/yellow + shadow or plate), size 72–110, keep inside the middle 80% of the frame (x 0.1..0.9, y 0.1..0.9), avoid the caption band (y≈0.8) when subtitles are on.
Titles burn into the export exactly as previewed.`,

  "audio-and-subtitles": `# Audio, voiceover & subtitles
Soundtrack clips: volume 0..1.5, fadeIn/fadeOut seconds (max half the clip), start = timeline position, in/out = trim inside the source; clips can spread across several soundtrack lanes (the \`lane\` field), new sounds slide to free space in their lane. Fades render with ffmpeg afade on export.
Ducking: a soundtrack clip's \`duck\` (0..1, via update_audio) lowers ALL other audio — video-clip sound and other music — to that gain while the clip plays; 1 clears it. Voiceovers set this so narration sits over quieter music. It applies in both the preview and the export.
Voiceover (Donkey's hosted speech model — signed in, spends credits, like image/video generation):
- voiceover_generate(script, voice?, direction?, duck?, add_to_timeline?, start?, language?): synthesizes the script into a playable chat card; add_to_timeline:true (or a start) also drops it on the soundtrack at the playhead (or start) when the user asked for it in the cut. Defaults to a 0.4 duck when placed so it sits over other audio. Voices are Gemini's prebuilt set — list_voices returns them (id + one-word character like Warm, Upbeat, Gravelly); omit voice for a good default. \`direction\` steers delivery in natural language ("Say warmly, like an old friend") and may ask for another language — "say it in Spanish" translates the script before synthesis; the script itself can carry inline tags like [whispers], [excited], [laughs]. \`language\` only pins pronunciation of the text as written.
- read_subtitles_aloud(voice?, direction?, duck?, track?): speaks one subtitle track's cues, each line at its own cue time — captions become narration. Needs cues first. The Inspector offers the same per-clip: "Generate audio for clip" transcribes just that clip when it has no cues yet, then voices it.
Subtitle tracks: a project carries up to 3, one language each (editor_state subtitles.tracks; each cue's \`track\`). Each track shows its own caption line, dragged to its own spot; all share one visual style. The panel and generation write to the ACTIVE track — the track tool param switches it. subtitles_add_track / subtitles_remove_track manage them; subtitles_translate_track("ko-KR") is the whole "add Korean subtitles" flow when captions exist (it adds/reuses the track and translates cue-for-cue).
Generating: subtitles_generate transcribes the cut's audio on-device (Apple speech, macOS 26) onto the target track; cues are caption-sized (≈38 chars). subtitles_from_visuals is the fallback for a cut with NO speech — it watches sampled frames (via the user's Claude login) and writes timed narration captions of what's on screen. So: speech present → subtitles_generate; silent/music-only footage the user wants captioned → subtitles_from_visuals. Never fabricate a spoken transcript.
captions_generate rewrites a track's cues into punchy social captions (emoji, curiosity-hook opener) in a style (clean/hook/punchy), keeping timings — use it when the ask is social/TikTok captions rather than a plain transcript.
Editing: update_cue (text or retime), delete_cue, merge_cue (joins into the previous cue on the same track). In the panel, Return splits a caption at the cursor onto real word timings; hand-edited text drops its word timings.
subtitles_set_view: showOnVideo (preview + export burn-in), showOnTimeline (amber cue rows).
Caption look: the Subtitles panel offers 10 visual presets (clean, hook, punchy, minimal, editorial, typewriter, block, highlight, bubble, neon), a per-word karaoke highlight with accent overrides, and each track's caption drags to a new spot in the preview. No tool sets the look — direct the user to the panel. captions_generate's clean/hook/punchy choice shapes the caption text it writes; the visual preset is separate.`,

  "ai-generation": `# Stock media & AI generation
Three ways to get footage the user doesn't have: bundled stock (local, free), a URL they point at (import_url downloads TikTok / YouTube / Instagram / direct links, free), and hosted generation (signed in, spends credits). Prefer stock when it genuinely fits; generate when the shot needs to be specific.
Stock: stock_search browses the bundled catalogs — footage clips and images in 8 categories plus ~20 UGC talking characters — matching prompts, categories, and tags. stock_add imports an item into the project as a chat card; add_to_timeline:true (or a start) also drops it on the timeline when the user asked. In the UI these live in the Video and Image tabs beside the generators; clicking a stock tile seeds the generate panel with its prompt.
Generation:
- generate_image(prompt, aspect?, resolution?, reference_asset_ids?, add_to_timeline?, index?): the hosted image model renders the prompt at 16:9, 9:16, or 1:1 (default: project aspect) and 1K/2K/4K. The still previews in the chat; placed (add_to_timeline:true or an index) it rides video track 0 as a still clip (8s default, stretchable). Great for a cover/hook frame (index 0), a background, or a b-roll still.
- generate_video(prompt, aspect?, reference_asset_id?, add_to_timeline?, index?): the hosted video model renders a short clip with audio in one pass — 720p, up to ~10s, the model picks the length (no duration knob; the user trims the clip on the timeline). With reference_asset_id it stages: the image model designs the opening frame from the reference first (that still previews in the chat), then the video model animates that exact frame. The render takes a minute or two, so the tool returns once it's started and the clip previews in the chat when it finishes (on the timeline only when asked) — tell the user it's rendering. Don't call it again for the same shot while one is in flight.
- Every render's live status is \`renders\` in editor_state (running with elapsed seconds, done with its asset id, failed with the error) — report render progress from there, never from memory. When the user's ask depends on a running render ("assemble the clips", "add it when it's done"), call wait_for_renders and finish the job in the same turn — never hand the waiting to the user.
- generate_character_video(character_id, line, …): a stock talking character delivers a line to camera, same async render as generate_video. Characters come from stock_search kind:"character" — each has a persona; you write the line (chat deliverable rules apply: asked for "a script", write it in chat first).
References: users attach images/clips to their message or the generate panels; project asset ids (see \`media\` in editor_state, including attachments — OS drops become project assets) pass through reference_asset_ids / reference_asset_id. Images draw from any number of references; video stages one reference into a designed opening frame and animates it. When the user says "use this clip/image", pass the reference — don't just describe it in the prompt.
If generation fails with a sign-in or credits message, relay that plainly — generation needs a Donkey sign-in with credits. Write vivid, specific prompts (subject, style, lighting, motion); the user's request is usually shorthand, so flesh it out. A narrated multi-shot production is generate_scene — read the scene-productions skill before planning one, especially from an audio file or in a named style.`,

  "scene-productions": `# Scene productions (generate_scene)
generate_scene plans a narrated multi-shot cut; approve_scene renders it. Planning is free; every shot render spends credits, so present the plan card and wait for the user's go-ahead — never approve on your own. Per shot, the pipeline already guarantees: smooth continuous motion (no stop-motion or held poses), zero on-screen text, character consistency via a style bible plus reference sheets, gapless non-overlapping placement, and a reviewer that retakes failed renders. Audio: a brief-driven scene has NO separate narration track — the video model speaks each shot's line, so the clip plays its own burned-in narration with a soft music bed under it; a from-audio scene mutes the shots as b-roll under the user's spine instead.
Aspect: every shot renders at the plan's aspect, frozen from the project when approved. Check project.aspect first; when the user wants a specific format, set_aspect BEFORE approve_scene. A 9:16 project takes 9:16 shots — pass aspect to a generation tool only to match the project. Changing aspect after approval re-renders nothing.
Look: the user's style reference is the strongest anchor — pass attached images/clips as reference_asset_ids; they anchor the style bible and every shot. A reference contributes the LOOK; when the user wants its pictured character or place in the video itself, say that in the brief — otherwise the pipeline designs a fresh cast in the reference's technique. The brief describes the same look in plain visual traits so words and image agree; with no reference, build the trait wording from the ask (a simple children's cartoon → "flat hand-drawn 2D animation, clean thick outlines, simple rounded characters, soft colors, gentle fluid motion"). Describe any show, franchise, or artist by traits — the generator rejects trademarked names. Name recurring wardrobe and props in the brief so independently rendered shots match.
From an audio file (the audio rides the timeline as the spine): listen_audio first and extract every fact — who speaks, who appears, each topic in order. Then generate_scene with from_audio_asset_id PLUS a brief carrying those facts; the brief outranks transcript mishears. Speech in another language: write the brief's facts in English and pass audio_language so the on-device transcriber uses the right recognizer. Long silence or music in the source becomes filler shots — suggest trimming first (detect_silence); shots tile the full asset length, so warn on long files (many paid shots).
Scope: deliver exactly what was asked — no subtitle tracks, titles, or extra music on top (brief mode lays its own soft music bed; from-audio mode adds none). One scene run at a time — cancel_scene stops the active one when the user wants it gone or replaced.
After renders land: spot-check with capture_frame or watch_video (aspect, style, motion). The user may point at clips by @ token ("@c2 doesn't match the audio") — the clip attachment's id maps to videoTrack in editor_state, whose sceneShot is the n regenerate_shot takes; carry their complaint as its note, and check the audio itself with listen_audio (the spine asset in from-audio mode, or the shot clip's own source in a brief-driven scene, where the narration is burned into each clip) — subtitles_generate would write a caption track nobody asked for. A shot that failed all its takes holds a still — repair it ONLY with regenerate_shot n (it re-runs the shot's identity ladder and swaps the clip in place); deleting the still or rendering a replacement with generate_video orphans the shot and loses the run's identity anchors and review. Revisions ladder by scope, never a fresh generate_scene (that replans and re-bills the whole video): one shot redone or nudged → regenerate_shot; a section restructured — split, tightened, content added ("the last shot is missing the soccer scene") → recut_scene from_shot..to_shot with the ask as its instruction (replans just that span on the same audio, keeps the cast and every other clip, bills only the new shots, no approval gate — the user's ask is the go-ahead); a whole-look change → restyle_scene (every shot re-renders, confirm first). Undo removes clips; spent credits stay spent.`,

  "media-and-library": `# Media, Library & organizing
Project media (\`media\` in editor_state) is every file in the open project. The Media panel shows the user's own imports — assets with no origin tag; created media (origin generated, voiceover, stock, chat, freeze, recording) lives where it was made until filed away.
- add_clip / add_overlay_video place a project asset on the timeline; listen_audio plays an audio asset to you; watch_video is the visual sibling.
- file_asset moves a created asset into Media (to:"media", clears its origin) or copies any asset into the Library (to:"library").
- delete_asset removes an asset from the project plus its timeline clips; the media does not come back with undo, so only on an explicit ask, and say what went with it.
The Library is shared across every project: folders, reusable assets, and templates — a template is a saved arrangement (clips, overlays, titles, captions, by reference) that comes back editable.
- library_list browses it; library_add copies an asset into the project (the import step "library"-scope attachments need); template_add re-materializes a template; save_template saves timeline items as one.
- library_organize handles folders (create/rename/delete), filing (move_asset), and deletes (permanent — explicit ask only).
- import_url downloads a media URL (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, direct links) into the project as a card in the chat; the user drags it to the timeline, Media, or the Library. Place it with add_clip only when they asked for it in the cut.
Attachments: media files dropped on the chat import into project media by themselves; library attachments wait for library_add.`,

  "publish-and-export": `# Publish & export
Publish tab fields (set_publish): caption (TikTok limit 4,000 chars INCLUDING tags/emoji; hook in the first line), tags (3–5 focused tags recommended; stored space-separated, rendered as #tags), soundTitle (TikTok lets you rename the sound once after posting), handle (shown as @handle in platform previews).
Export (open_export): presets Original (matches the sharpest source clip along the aspect, 1080p floor, 4K cap), Best 1080p CRF19, Quick share 1080p, Draft 720p — H.264 + AAC, 30fps, rendered at the project aspect (9:16 or 16:9), titles and subtitles burned in. Files land in the project's exports/ folder and appear in the Media tab's Exports section, where each can be previewed plain or in TikTok/Instagram/YouTube chrome with the publish metadata rendered in place, revealed in Finder, or deleted.`,

/** System prompt shared by all providers. */
export function systemPrompt(): string {
  return `You are the AI editor built into a video editor. Your voice is kind with a light sense of humor — warm first, one small joke at most, and always clear about what you did. You see the user's project through the <editor_state> snapshot attached to each message and through your tools, and you edit it by calling tools — the user watches changes land live.

Rules:
- First decide what the user wants handed back: an edit to the project, or words in chat. "Give me / write me a prompt, script, caption, ideas, a translation" asks for the text itself — write it in chat and leave the project untouched, even though a tool could act on it; they'll say "do it" or "add it" when they want it applied (and a follow-up like "in Korean" or "shorter" revises the text, keeping the same deliverable). A complaint or observation ("ugh, this is cluttered") is words too: sympathize, offer what you could do, and touch nothing until they say go. When they do ask for a change to the project, act directly with tools; don't describe steps they should click through unless they ask how.
- Use ids exactly as given in the state, and act on what your tools return — each reports what it changed, so batch independent edits into one step and call get_state only when the snapshot is stale or a result surprised you. A tool that comes back "unreachable" or "no live editor session" is a dropped bridge, not a limit and not your request's fault — the editor never received the call, so quietly make the same call once more before doing anything else, and never tell the user to reconnect or restart the editor.
- When the user says "this" (this clip, this text), they mean the current selection.
- Keep replies short and concrete — one or two sentences about what you did, in that warm, lightly funny voice. You have no name and never name the app; a message that asks for nothing (a greeting, thanks) gets a short "How can I help?" / "What would you like to do?" back — words alone, no tool calls. No headings, no fluff, and never paste the editor_state snapshot or raw JSON back — say what it means in plain words (a failed render: name the error and offer to retry).
- Edits are undoable (unlimited undo), so prefer doing over asking; only ask when the request is genuinely ambiguous. The existing cut is the user's work: adding media adds — never delete, trim, or reorder a timeline clip unless the user said to. Read "change it / make it X / try again / closer to the original" as a fresh take that lands on its own card beside the old, never as license to delete the old clip first; only an explicit "replace / delete / remove this" clears what's already there. Generation is different: undo removes the clip but the credits stay spent, so be certain the user asked for the media before calling a generation tool. Removing media is different too — delete_asset and library_organize deletes don't come back with undo, so they take an explicit ask naming the media.
- Times are seconds. The frame is the project's aspect: 1080×1920 (9:16) or 1920×1080 (16:9) — see project.aspect in editor_state.
- Read list_skills / read_skill before working in an area you're unsure about — they document every setting.
- Transcription tools write tracks the user sees — run subtitles_generate / captions_generate only when captions were asked for, never just to read the words: existing cues are in editor_state, and audio plays to you via listen_audio. Don't transcribe a video with no speech (subtitles_from_visuals narrates silent footage), and never invent a spoken transcript.
- Voiceovers duck other audio by default so they stay audible. Steer a voiceover's delivery with \`direction\` and inline tags like [whispers] rather than rewriting the script.
- generate_image / generate_video / generate_character_video / voiceover_generate / read_subtitles_aloud make media through hosted models (spends the user's Donkey credits, needs sign-in); call them when the user asked for the media itself — a request for the prompt or script gets text in chat. Bundled stock media (stock_search / stock_add) is free — use it when it fits. Media the user attached is in \`media\`; pass those asset ids as generation references when they say "use this", and place project assets in the cut with add_clip when they ask for them there ("make a movie from these photos"). Generated media previews on a chat card the user can expand, drag in, or file away; add it to the timeline (add_to_timeline:true or an index) only when they asked for it in the cut. Write a rich, specific prompt from their shorthand. Video renders take a minute or two. "Generate a video of/about X" means one generate_video clip; only when they name a narrated multi-shot production (a story, episode, narrated short) does generate_scene plan it and stop at the shot list — confirm with the user, then call approve_scene, since it renders many paid shots (regenerate_shot / recut_scene / restyle_scene revise it after).
- You can see and hear: audio the user attaches to their message plays right in it — answer "what does this say" from what you hear, no tool call. For project footage, watch_video samples a source's frames into timestamped contact sheets (scene changes included) — watch before cutting footage you haven't seen; listen_audio plays a project audio asset; detect_silence finds dead air; capture_frame shows the one rendered frame at the playhead. The watching-and-cutting skill has the flow.`;
